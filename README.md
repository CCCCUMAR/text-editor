# [Description](#table-of-contents)

The goal of this project was to build a single page application using IndexDB meeting PWA critteria.

## [Installation](#table-of-contents)

To run the application you will need to install al of the dependencies in package.json files.

## [How-To](#table-of-contents)

Once all the packages are installed, just type `npm run start` to get everything going.
